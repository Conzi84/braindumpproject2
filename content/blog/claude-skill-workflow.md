# This Simple Claude Skill Replaced My 5-Step Workflow (and Gave Me My Evenings Back)

The following blog post is an idea of making my life easier. It is not implemented yet, just a futureME post. Enjoy reading. 

Every evening, I record a short voice note — just a few minutes of raw thoughts from the day. Wins, worries, ideas, reflections. It’s part of my **Brain Dump Project** — a habit I built to clear my head and end the day intentionally.  

But the process that came after? Not so simple.  
I’d transcribe the note, paste it into ChatGPT, load my saved prompt, open another tab to grab my Markdown template, merge it all, generate my **Daily Sprint Note**, and finally copy it into Obsidian.  

Five steps. Three tools. Constant switching.  
It worked — but it killed the flow. Some nights, I skipped the reflection entirely because the setup felt like work.  

And that’s the hidden pain point for many AI users: **AI tools are powerful, but the workflow isn’t fluid.** We spend more time managing prompts and templates than actually thinking.  
And some evenings I was just too lazy for this workflow.  
App switching disturbs creativity and interrupts seamless thinking.

## The Turning Point

One day, I caught myself dreading the process again and thought: *That is so annoying! How can I make it simpler?*  
What if I could just record my thoughts and my AI automatically turned them into a clean, structured note — no copy-paste, no switching apps, no friction?  

That question changed everything.  

I discovered **Claude Skills**, Anthropic’s modular instruction system. Each skill is like a small “AI app” — a self-contained workflow that tells Claude exactly what to do, how to do it, and how to format the result.  

So I built my own. *(And expanded that idea into a PWA with vibe coding — but that’s another story.)*

## The Solution: `@daily-sprint`

My custom Claude Skill takes one input — my **brain dump transcript** — and instantly outputs my **Daily Sprint Note** in perfect Markdown format.  
It includes sections like “Top 3 Priorities,” “Mental Clarity,” and “Timeblocks,” exactly as I’d normally write them.  

Now, my evening routine is simple:  
I record my voice, upload the transcript, and call the skill (`@daily-sprint`).  
Claude does the rest — automatically.  

No templates.  
No prompts.  
No copy-paste.  
Just structure and clarity — instantly.

## The Benefits

Since building this, my nightly reflections take minutes instead of ten or fifteen.  
I no longer lose energy switching between tools or devices.  
And for the first time, my **AI workflow matches the way I think** — fast, contextual, and seamless.  

The benefits extend beyond journaling.  
If you use AI regularly — for writing, planning, summarizing, or managing projects — **Claude Skills can turn repetitive processes into one-command automations.**  
They bridge the gap between thought and execution, giving your AI the context it needs to act like a true assistant, not just a text generator.

## Final Thought

Productivity isn’t about using more AI tools.  
It’s about **removing friction** between your thoughts and the tools that bring them to life.  

My simple Claude Skill didn’t just save me time — it brought **simplicity** back to my evening reflection routine.  
And that, more than anything, is what technology should do.
