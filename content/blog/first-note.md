This is where it starts. No polish, no perfection—just raw thoughts hitting the page.

## The Setup

I work at a local energy provider managing risk and implementing AI systems. Sounds corporate, but the real work happens in the gaps: intraday futures trading during market hours, building side projects after the kids sleep, experimenting with tools like Claude and Cursor.

## The Problem

My Obsidian vault is full of notes that never see daylight. Insights about AI workflows & ai governance issues, trading patterns, general risk frameworks—all locked in markdown files on my laptop. And even it is not a problem, I have so many interests and been curious about using ai, that I already learned so much, I did not share yet.

## The Solution

Build in public. One note at a time. This site is the pipeline: Obsidian → GitHub → Netlify. 

No waiting for perfection. Just publish and iterate.

## What's Next

- Document my AI implementation process at work, sharing learning all over the field
- Share side projects, like the origin idea of why doing "brain dumps" and what it is about
- Build tools that solve my problems, always knowing, that a spoken word about these processes might help others solve their problems

Let's see where this goes.
