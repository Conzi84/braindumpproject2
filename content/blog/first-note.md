# First Brain Dump: Why I'm Building This

This is where it starts. No polish, no perfection—just raw thoughts hitting the page.

## The Setup

I work at a municipal energy provider managing risk and implementing AI systems. Sounds corporate, but the real work happens in the gaps: intraday futures trading during market hours, building side projects after the kids sleep, experimenting with tools like Claude and Cursor.

## The Problem

My Obsidian vault is full of notes that never see daylight. Insights about AI workflows, trading patterns, risk frameworks—all locked in markdown files on my laptop.

## The Solution

Build in public. One note at a time. This site is the pipeline: Obsidian → GitHub → Netlify. 

No waiting for perfection. Just publish and iterate.

## What's Next

- Document my AI implementation process at work
- Share trading journal insights (the ones that don't violate compliance)
- Build tools that solve my own problems first

Let's see where this goes.
