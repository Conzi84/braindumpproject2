# My AI Workflow: ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor

After months of experimenting, I've settled into a three-tool system that actually works.

## The Division of Labor

**ChatGPT** → Planning & Strategy
- Brainstorming project structure
- Breaking down complex tasks
- Exploring different approaches

**Claude** → Building & Content
- Writing documentation
- Creating components
- This entire site's foundation

**Cursor** → Coding & Refactoring
- Actual implementation
- Debugging
- Structure refinements

## Why This Works

Each tool has strengths. ChatGPT excels at high-level thinking. Claude is better at sustained, detailed work. Cursor understands codebases.

Using all three = covering blind spots.

## The Reality

It's messy. I switch contexts constantly. Sometimes I forget which tool I asked what. But the output? Way better than working solo.

## Next Experiment

Testing if Claude can help with risk analysis reports at work. Will document results.
