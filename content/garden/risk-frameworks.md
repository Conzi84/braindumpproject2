# Risk Management Frameworks

## What is Risk Management?

At its core: identifying, assessing, and controlling threats to capital and earnings.

In energy: equipment failure, regulatory changes, commodity price volatility.

In trading: position sizing, drawdown limits, correlation exposure.

## The Four Pillars

### 1. Identification
- What can go wrong?
- Run scenario analysis
- Map dependencies

### 2. Assessment
- Likelihood × Impact matrix
- Quantify where possible
- Acknowledge uncertainty

### 3. Mitigation
- Hedge exposures
- Diversify sources
- Build redundancy

### 4. Monitoring
- Real-time dashboards
- Alert thresholds
- Regular reviews

## Application to AI Projects

Same framework applies:
- **Identify**: What if the model hallucinates critical data?
- **Assess**: How often? What's the business impact?
- **Mitigate**: Human review layers, confidence thresholds
- **Monitor**: Track accuracy over time

## Why This Matters

Risk management isn't about avoiding risk—it's about taking calculated risks with eyes open.

Energy, trading, AI... same principles, different variables.
