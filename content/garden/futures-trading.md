# Intraday Futures Trading Notes

## The Market I Trade

**ES (S&P 500 E-mini)** and **NQ (Nasdaq 100 E-mini)**

Liquid, volatile, perfect for 1-4 hour windows when I can focus.

## What I've Learned

### Time of Day Matters

**9:30-10:30 AM ET** → Highest volatility, most opportunities
- Market opens, algorithms hunt stops
- News gets priced in

**11:00 AM-2:00 PM** → Choppy, avoid
- Low volume, fake breakouts
- Better to step away

**2:30-4:00 PM** → Second window
- Institutional positioning for close
- Cleaner trends

### Position Sizing

Never risk more than 1% of account per trade. Period.

With ES at $50/point, that means tight stops. Forces discipline.

### Patterns That Repeat

1. **Opening range breakout** → Wait 15 minutes, then trade the break
2. **Failed breakout** → Fade the move, tight stop
3. **VWAP retest** → Price respects VWAP like gravity

### What Doesn't Work

- Revenge trading after a loss (learned this the hard way)
- Trading during Fed announcements (too random)
- Ignoring risk management "just this once"

## Integration with AI

Currently testing: Can Claude analyze my trade journal and spot patterns I miss?

Early results: Yes. It caught that I win more on Tuesday/Thursday. No idea why yet.

## Work in Progress

This note evolves. Every trading session adds data.
