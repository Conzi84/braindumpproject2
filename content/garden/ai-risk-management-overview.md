# AI Risk Management Overview

## Why It Matters

AI is no longer experimental — it’s operational.  
From automated decision-making to text generation, models now influence financial results, customer experiences, and even compliance exposure. Managing these systems means managing **risk**.

AI Risk Management ensures that innovation stays aligned with ethics, regulation, and strategy. It’s not about slowing progress; it’s about **making progress safely**.

## The Core Dimensions

1. **Technical Risks**  
   - Model bias, data drift, hallucination, unreliable outputs  
   - Insufficient testing or explainability  
   - Dependence on opaque third-party APIs  

2. **Organizational Risks**  
   - Lack of accountability or ownership  
   - Shadow AI use without IT/ISMS oversight  
   - Skills gap between technical teams and decision-makers  

3. **Regulatory Risks**  
   - Non-compliance with **EU AI Act**, **DSGVO**, or sector laws  
   - Missing documentation (risk classification, logs, audit trails)  
   - Vendor dependencies without clear contractual safeguards  

## Building a Framework

An effective AI Risk Management system combines:  
- **Governance:** roles, responsibilities, and review cycles  
- **Controls:** risk assessments, DSFA, technical testing  
- **Monitoring:** continuous evaluation, incident logging, retraining thresholds  
- **Culture:** awareness, training, transparency  

Each of these layers turns abstract “AI ethics” into measurable practice.

## The Goal

Establish a system where AI supports — not surprises — the organization.  
Compliance isn’t the finish line; it’s the foundation for **trustworthy AI**.

## Work in Progress

As the EU AI Act enters enforcement, every organization must learn to map, monitor, and mature its AI landscape.  
This note evolves with that journey.
