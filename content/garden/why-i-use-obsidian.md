# Why I Use Obsidian

## The Problem

My brain never stops.  
Ideas, notes, meeting summaries, trading insights, risk analyses — all scattered across tools and files.  
Nothing ever felt like a system. Until **Obsidian**.

## The Core Idea

Obsidian isn’t just a note app.  
It’s a **thinking environment** — plain Markdown, full control, and a graph that mirrors how ideas connect.

Each note starts as a **brain dump**.  
Later, I link it, refine it, and watch patterns emerge between topics: Controlling, AI, trading, even personal reflections. Over time, these fragments evolve into frameworks, prompts, or full project plans.

## My Daily Loop

**Brain Dump** → raw thoughts in the morning  
**Morning Briefing** → turn chaos into priorities  
**System Building** → connect notes into workflows  
**Export or Publish** → from note → product → public  

Everything stays local, searchable, and future-proof.

## Why It Works for Me

- Markdown = no lock-in, no platform trap  
- Graph View = see how ideas connect over time  
- Plugins = build my own knowledge workflows  
- Privacy = I own every file  

## Integration with AI

I use ChatGPT and Claude directly from inside my vault to summarize, connect, and expand on notes — my own **AI-augmented second brain**.

## Work in Progress

This vault grows with me.  
Every idea gets captured. Every project connects.  
It’s not about perfection — it’s about momentum.
